# In-The-Wild Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs

This is the official repository for the ACM CCS 2024 paper ["Do Anything Now'': Characterizing and Evaluating In-The-Wild Jailbreak Prompts on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03825) by [Xinyue Shen](https://xinyueshen.me/), [Zeyuan Chen](https://picodora.github.io/), [Michael Backes](https://michaelbackes.eu/), Yun Shen, and [Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/).

In this project, employing our new framework JailbreakHub, we conduct the first measurement study on jailbreak prompts in the wild, with **15,140 prompts** collected from December 2022 to December 2023 (including **1,405 jailbreak prompts**).

Check out our [website here](https://jailbreak-llms.xinyueshen.me/).

## Data

## Prompts

Overall, we collect 15,140 prompts from four platforms (Reddit, Discord, websites, and open-source datasets) during Dec 2022 to Dec 2023. Among these prompts, we identify 1,405 jailbreak prompts. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset serves as the largest collection of in-the-wild jailbreak prompts.

**Load Prompts**

You can use the Hugging Face [`Datasets`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TrustAIRLab/in-the-wild-jailbreak-prompts) library to easily load all collected prompts.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset('TrustAIRLab/in-the-wild-jailbreak-prompts', 'jailbreak_2023_05_07', split='train')
# dataset = load_dataset('TrustAIRLab/in-the-wild-jailbreak-prompts', 'jailbreak_2023_12_25', split='train')
# dataset = load_dataset('TrustAIRLab/in-the-wild-jailbreak-prompts', 'regular_2023_05_07', split='train')
# dataset = load_dataset('TrustAIRLab/in-the-wild-jailbreak-prompts', 'regular_2023_12_25', split='train')
```

The original csv files are provided in our GitHub repo [jailbreak_llms](https://github.com/verazuo/jailbreak_llms/tree/main/data).

Note: If you plan to use this dataset to train models, preprocessing the `prompt` field to remove duplicates is recommended.
For more details, see [this discussion](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TrustAIRLab/in-the-wild-jailbreak-prompts/discussions/3).

## Question Set

To evaluate the effectiveness of jailbreak prompts, we construct a question set comprising 390 questions across 13 forbidden scenarios adopted from [OpenAI Usage Policy](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies).

We exclude `Child Sexual Abuse` scenario from our evaluation and focus on the rest 13 scenarios, including `Illegal Activity`, `Hate Speech`, `Malware Generation`, `Physical Harm`, `Economic Harm`, `Fraud`, `Pornography`, `Political Lobbying`, `Privacy Violence`, `Legal Opinion`, `Financial Advice`, `Health Consultation`, and `Government Decision`.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

forbidden_question_set = load_dataset("TrustAIRLab/forbidden_question_set", split='train')
```

The original file of the question set is also provided in our GitHub repo [jailbreak_llms](https://github.com/verazuo/jailbreak_llms/tree/main/data).

## Ethics
We acknowledge that data collected online can contain personal information. Thus, we adopt standard best practices to guarantee that our study follows ethical principles, such as not trying to deanonymize any user and reporting results on aggregate. Since this study only involved publicly available data and had no interactions with participants, it is not regarded as human subjects research by our Institutional Review Boards (IRB). Nonetheless, since one of our goals is to measure the risk of LLMs in answering harmful questions, it is inevitable to disclose how a model can generate hateful content. This can bring up worries about potential misuse. However, we strongly believe that raising awareness of the problem is even more crucial, as it can inform LLM vendors and the research community to develop stronger safeguards and contribute to the more responsible release of these models.

We have responsibly disclosed our findings to related LLM vendors.

## Corpus v5 use status

TrustAIRLab contributes 6,666 benign primary-stratum samples. Its JB prompts share one primary stratum with WUSTL; the combined TrustAIRLab+WUSTL stratum selects 1,573 rows, including 437 rows with WUSTL provenance. Full source memberships are preserved in the corpus and manifest. The GitHub snapshot `verazuo/jailbreak_llms` is an exact-source mirror and is not counted as an additional dataset.
